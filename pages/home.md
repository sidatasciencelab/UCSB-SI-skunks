The island spotted skunk is a rare California carnivore distributed throughout the California Channel Islands. Students and mentors in [the UCSB-Smithsonian Scholars](https://oep.ucsb.edu/programs/smithsonian-scholars-program) program work with partners at The Nature Conservancy to collect images of skunks using motion activated camera traps. As interns, scholars work directly with the [Smithsonian Data Science Lab](https://datascience.si.edu/) to automate data management and accelerate the use of these images using machine learning. This site includes a general description of the project, our team, and step-by-step instructions for implementing code written by scholars interns.
