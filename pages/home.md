The [island spotted skunk](https://www.islandspottedskunk.com/) is a rare California carnivore distributed throughout the California Channel Islands. Students and mentors in [the UCSB-Smithsonian Scholars](https://oep.ucsb.edu/programs/smithsonian-scholars-program) program work with partners at [The Nature Conservancy](https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/places-we-protect/santa-cruz-island-california/) to collect images of skunks using motion activated camera traps. As interns, scholars work directly with the [Smithsonian Data Science Lab](https://datascience.si.edu/) to automate data management and accelerate the use of these images using machine learning. 

## Image Data Management

Our project aims to follow the [CamTrap Data Package](https://tdwg.github.io/camtrap-dp/) data exchange format for camera trap data. Workflow details, documentation for data management, and machine learning applications are explained at the following links:
