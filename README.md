## UCSB-Smithsonian Scholars Spotted Skunk Population Monitoring

This is a repo for the UCSB-Smithsonian Scholars spotted skunk project [website](sidatasciencelab.github.io/UCSB-SI-skunks). Project code and further documentation is located in a different repo [here](https://github.com/sidatasciencelab/SCI_skunks). This project represents the collective effort of dozens of UCSB-Smithsonian Scholars who have contributed their time and effort in the field to collect these data and manage our camera trap deployments. Data Science Interns (2nd year scholars) worked with the Smithsonian Data Science Lab to implement a data management scheme and develop machine learning models to classify camera trap images and identify island spotted skunks.

The project is a collaboration between The University of California-Santa Barbara Office of Education Partnerships, the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, the Smithsonian Data Science Lab, and the Nature Conservancy.
